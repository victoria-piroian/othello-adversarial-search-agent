# othello-adversarial-search-agent
Built an intelligent Othello (Reversi) AI using adversarial game tree search. Implemented Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning with depth limits, state caching, node ordering, and a custom heuristic. The agent efficiently evaluates game states under strict time constraints to make strategic decisions.
